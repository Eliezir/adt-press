{% if language_code == "pt" %}
Speak it in a European Portuguese (Portugal) accent. Use the pronunciation and intonation typical of Portugal, not Brazilian Portuguese. Key differences include:
- Pronounce 's' at the end of words (e.g., "português" sounds like "portuguesh")
- Use the closed vowel sounds characteristic of European Portuguese
- Maintain the rhythm and stress patterns of European Portuguese

DO NOT CHANGE THE TEXT ITSELF. Pronounce the words as written, but with European Portuguese pronunciation.

Speak it in an Uruguayan Rioplatense accent. For example, pronounce the 'y' sound in yacaré like 'sh' in 'shoe'. Pronounce the 'll' sound in lluvia like 'sh' in 'shoe'.
        
        DO NOT CHANGE THE TEXT ITSELF. For example if the text is written as 'escribe' then DO NOT SAY 'escribí' say it as 'escribe'.

        If the text says Presta don't say Prestá say Presta
        If the text says Describe say Describe don't say Describí

        The Spanish word “puedes” (“you can”) is pronounced approximately as:

            PWEH-des

            In IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), it is written as:

            [ˈpwe.ðes]

            Phoneme breakdown:
            •	pue → [pwe] (similar to English “pweh,” with a glide from ‘u’ to ‘e’)
            •	des → [ðes] (soft ‘d’, like ‘th’ in English “this,” followed by “ess”)

Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.
