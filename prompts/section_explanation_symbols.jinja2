I will provide you with input from a section of a textbook.
Transform the section into easy-read text following standard easy-read guidelines for accessibility.

EASY-READ GUIDELINES:
- Write short sentences (maximum 10-15 words per sentence)
- Use simple, everyday words - avoid jargon and complex vocabulary
- Use active voice (e.g., "The cat sat" not "The cat was sat")
- Put one main idea in each sentence
- Use positive language when possible
- Be clear and direct
- Keep the same verb tense throughout
- Retain key pedagogical terms from the original text that students need to learn

OUTPUT:
Provide the easy-read text as simple sentences in the target language.
Put each sentence on a new line for clarity.
Do NOT include any reasoning, meta-commentary, JSON, or markup.
Just provide the easy-read sentences themselves, nothing else.

I will provide you these inputs:
- The Page of the textbook the section is from, for context. THIS IS JUST FOR CONTEXT. YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON SIMPLIFYING THE SECTION TEXT + IMAGES I PROVIDED. Do not reference a spatial location on the page.
- The section text. USE THIS INFORMATION.
- The images for the section. USE THIS INFORMATION.

Provide me the answer in the given structure. Please take your time and think carefully before giving me the answers.
